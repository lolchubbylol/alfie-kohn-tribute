## About Alfie Kohn

Alfie Kohn challenges conventional wisdom about education, parenting, and human behavior. His work demonstrates that rewards and punishments are counterproductive, that competition undermines excellence, and that people flourish when their basic needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence are satisfied.
